The Jypyter notebook pymaceuticals.ipynb generates tables and charts needed for the technical report of a clinical study for potential treatments for a commonly occurring skin cancer. In the study a total of 248 mice were analyzed (51% male and 49% female). The mice treated with Capomulin (mean tumor volume: 40.67mm3) and Ramicane (mean tumor volume: 40.21mm3) had the smallest tumor volume mean values among all the drug regimen. The tumor volumes of mice treated with the Ramicane regimen were closest to the mean with smallest variance (23.48) and standard deviation (4.84). The final tumor volumes for mice treated with Ramicane had the lowest upper and lower bounds.

This analysis contains:
- Written analysis of trends in the dataset
- Limitations of the dataset and how to address the limitations
- Cleaned data (dropping all data for duplicated results)
- Summary Statistics for Tumor Volume
- Bar Chart (number of mice tested per drug)
- Pie Chart (sex distribution of mice)
- Outlier analysis of Tumor Volume for 4 drugs
- Box Plots for the same 4 drugs
- Line Chart of Tumor Volume vs. Time for one mouse
- Scatter plot of average mouse weight vs average Tumor Volume
- Correlation and regression analysis for the scatter plot data
